# weather-dashboard

## Description

The goal of this challenge was to create a weather dashboard that is able to forecast a city's weather over the next 5 days using a third party API. We were also required to implement local storage in order to create a search history.

## Usage

This webpage can be used search a 5-day weather forecast for any city. Once a user searches for a city, it will become a button that can be clicked again to be searched once more
